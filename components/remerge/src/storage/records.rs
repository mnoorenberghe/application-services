//! This module provides wrappers around JsonValue that allow for better
//! documentation and type safety for the format a method (usually in `db.rs`)
//! is expected to take/return.
//!
//! XXX The names "Local" vs "Native" here (and around) is confusing, but beats
//! everything passing around `serde_json::Value`s directly, and it matches the
//! terms used in the RFC. I'm open to name suggestions, though.
